Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements for th e app were to have an email and password log in along with a database to store the user accounts. The app was to also have a database for storing
the users weight and goal weight in which they could keep track of through a grid which when prompted would show them their entries. The third goal was to have the option
for notifications should the user want to be notified if they have reached their target goal or have it disabled.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The feature that was necessary to support user needs was to have a screen so the user could enter the day, their weight, and goal weight in one easy way. 
The UI was made in order to have the user be able to do everything in one screen, they can add their info, they can update an entry, delete an entry, or view all of them.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I needed to learn now to implement the log in as well as the SQLite database in order to store the data of users and data entries. Then needed to create the process of CRUD for implementing the data for the weight.
I worked on one section at a time. First beginning with the log in and so on. I tested to make sure each section was working properly before going onto the next in order to make sure that there were no issues. 
I stuck to this strategy of working on one piece at a time to avoid doing all the code and then backtracking to fix any issues that may have arised. If there was way more work done then finding the issues could have taken me much longer to fix them.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

To test the app I created an account and then tested to see if the log in process which was successful. However it did show that there is an issue where the log in button below
does not work until you click the sign up button first even if you are not creating an account. After you press that button then the log in button works normally. 
As for entering/editing/removing/viewing data the process works efficiently. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I really had to look into how the SQLite database was operated in android studio. Looking into tutorial readings and videos to find the info I needed was crucial. As for implementing the code,
I needed to go back and test periodically to make sure that the data was being stored properly which thankfully it was. I feel like that implementation of SQLite was done very well and I feel like that is my biggest accomplishment in the coding for this app.
